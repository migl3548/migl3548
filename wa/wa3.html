            <p> Takoyaki (Japanese: たこ焼き or 蛸焼) is a ball-shaped Japanese snack made of a wheat flour-based batter and cooked in a special molded pan. It is typically filled with minced or diced octopus (tako), tempura scraps (tenkasu), pickled ginger (beni shoga), and green onion (negi).[1][2] The balls are brushed with takoyaki sauce (similar to Worcestershire sauce) and mayonnaise, and then sprinkled with green laver (aonori) and shavings of dried bonito (katsuobushi).

                Yaki comes from yaku (焼く), which is one of the cooking methods in Japanese cuisine, meaning 'to grill', and can be found in the names of other dishes in Japanese cuisine such as okonomiyaki and ikayaki (other famous Osakan dishes).[3] Typically, it is eaten as a snack or between meals, but in some areas it is served as a side dish with rice. It is an example of konamono (konamon in the Kansai dialect), or flour-based Japanese cuisine.</p>
                
            <h2 id="s1">History</h2>
            <p>Takoyaki was first popularized in Osaka,[4] where a street vendor named Tomekichi Endo is credited with its invention in 1935. Takoyaki was inspired by akashiyaki, a small round dumpling from the city of Akashi in Hyōgo Prefecture made of an egg-rich batter and octopus.[5] Takoyaki was initially popular in the Kansai region, and later spread to the Kantō region and other areas of Japan. Takoyaki is associated with yatai street food stalls, and there are many well-established takoyaki specialty restaurants, particularly in the Kansai region. Takoyaki is now sold at commercial outlets, such as supermarkets and 24-hour convenience stores.</p>
            <p>It is also very popular in Taiwanese cuisine due to the historical influence of Japanese culture.</p>
            <p>The oldest known takoyaki store is Aizuya（会津屋） in Osaka. Founded by Tomakichi Endo, it has been open since the 1930s. The first takoyaki included beef and konjac, but later Endo switched to using the now traditional octopus and added flavor to the batter. The takoyaki are then eaten with brown sauce, similar to Worcestershire sauce. In recent years, takoyaki can be eaten with various toppings and fillings (such as cheese or bacon[8]) as its cultural span has evolved in western parts of the world. The food, known as "octopus balls", quickly became popular throughout Japan.[9][10]</p>

            <h2 id="s2">Takoyaki pan</h2>
            <p>A takoyaki pan (たこ焼き器, takoyaki-ki) or—much more rarely—takoyaki nabe is typically a griddle made of cast iron with hemispherical molds, similar to a traditional Yorkshire Pudding tray.[2] The heavy iron evenly heats the takoyaki, which are turned with a pick during the heating process to pull the uncooked batter to the base of the rounded cavity. Commercial gas-fueled takoyaki cookers are used at Japanese festivals or by street vendors. For home use, electric versions resemble a hotplate; stovetop versions are also available, and many incorporate a non-stick coating to facilitate turning.</p>

            <h2 id="s3">In popular culture</h2>
            <p>Takoyaki is the favorite food of Taruruto, the title character of the 1988 manga series Magical Taruruto. The food plays a major role in several episodes of the anime and a single tie-in film, and also serves as the many collectibles and potential platforms in several tie-in video games.[11]

                A children's book named Takoyaki Mantoman, published in the 1990s and later adapted into an anime television series produced by Studio Pierrot that aired from April 1998 to September 1999, focuses on a group of takoyaki fighting crime.
                
                In the Animal Crossing series of video games, there is a villager named Zucker, based on takoyaki. He is an octopus with a round head resembling takoyaki, he generally wears a yukata, and his home is inspired by a traditional Japanese summer festival.[citation needed]
                
                An Internet meme originating from the Philippines showcases a variation of the food in a viral video with the phrase, "Nakatikim ka na ba ng tig-dalawang pisong takoyaki?", meaning "Have you ever tried the "two-peso takoyaki"?". Even though the food showcased in the video does not contain any octopus, the uploader continues to describe it as such thus resulting into many variations of the meme</p>

            
            

            <h2 id="s4">Food that pairs well</h2>
            <p>Boba</p>
            <p>Bubble tea (also known as pearl milk tea, bubble milk tea, tapioca milk tea, boba tea, or boba; Chinese: 珍珠奶茶; pinyin: zhēnzhū nǎichá, 波霸奶茶; bōbà nǎichá) is a tea-based drink that originated in Taiwan in the early 1980s.[1][2] Taiwanese immigrants brought it to the United States in the 1990s, initially in California through regions including Los Angeles County,[3] but the drink has also spread to other countries where there is a large East Asian diaspora population.

                Bubble tea most commonly consists of tea accompanied by chewy tapioca balls ("boba" or "pearls"), but it can be made with other toppings as well, such as grass jelly, aloe vera, red bean, and popping boba. It has many varieties and flavors, but the two most popular varieties are pearl black milk tea and pearl green milk tea ("pearl" for the tapioca balls at the bottom).</p>
            
            <p>Agedashi dōfu</p>
            <p>Agedashi dōfu (揚げ出し豆腐, "lightly deep-fried tofu") is a Japanese hot tofu dish. Soft or medium-firm silken tofu (kinugoshi) is cut into cubes, before being lightly dusted with potato starch or cornstarch and then deep fried until golden brown. It is then served in a hot broth (tentsuyu) made of dashi, mirin, and shō-yu (Japanese soy sauce), with finely-chopped negi (a type of spring onion) and grated daikon or katsuobushi (dried skipjack tuna flakes) sprinkled on top.[1]</p>

            <h2 id="s5">Octopus as food</h2>
            <p>Japan</p>
            <p>Octopus is a common ingredient in Japanese cuisine, including sushi, sashimi, karaage, stew, sour salad, takoyaki and akashiyaki.

                Takoyaki is a ball-shaped snack made of a wheat flour-based batter and cooked in a special takoyaki pan. It is typically filled with minced or diced octopus, tempura scraps (tenkasu), pickled ginger, and green onion.[1][2] Takoyaki are brushed with takoyaki sauce, similar to Worcestershire sauce, and mayonnaise. The takoyaki is then sprinkled with small strips of laver and shavings of dried bonito.</p>
            <p>Korea</p>
            <p>Giant octopus, long arm octopus, and webfoot octopus are common food ingredients in Korean cuisine.

            In Korea, some small species are sometimes eaten raw as a novelty food. A raw octopus is usually sliced up, seasoned quickly with salt and sesame seeds and eaten while still squirming posthumously.
            
            Nakji bokkeum is another popular dish in Korea. It is a type of stir-fried food made with chopped octopus.></p>
            <p>Maldives</p>
            <p>Miruhulee boava is a Maldivian delicacy made of octopus tentacles braised in curry leaves, chili, garlic, cloves, onion, pepper, and coconut oil.[3]</p>
            
            <p>Mauritius</p>
            <p>In Mauritius and Rodrigues, octopus, known by its Mauritian Creole name "Ourite" is commonly eaten especially in coastal regions as it is found abundantly in Mauritian waters, although a sharp decline has been observed recently. Popular octopus dishes include the masala octopus curry or boiled octopus in spicy tomato sauce, known as the "Daube".</p>

            <p>Mexico</p>
            <p>In Baja California, octopus is commonly grilled and eaten on its own or as a component of tacos, tostadas, and ceviche.</p>
            
            <p>Greece</p>
            <p>A common scene in the Greek islands is octopuses hanging in the sunlight from a rope, just like laundry from a clothesline. They are often caught by spear fishing close to the shore. The fisherman brings his prey to land and tenderizes the flesh by pounding the carcass against a stone surface. Thus treated, they are hung out to dry, and later will be served grilled, either hot or chilled in a salad. A common preparation technique involves classic Greek spices and seasonings, often including olive oil, garlic cloves, oregano, pepper, and lemon juice.[4] On the whole, octopus is considered a superb meze, especially alongside ouzo.[5]</p>
