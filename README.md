# Test

## hi :3
### I'm a third year cs major and ctd minor, and my goals for this course are to build on the stuff I learned in csci3308 software dev, and get better at cool frontend web dev stuff like animations and making fun interactive stuff. When I'm not sobbing while doing my PPL homework, I'm usually playing fps games.
